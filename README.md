# UK Income Tax Calculator
 
This project is a UK income tax calculator designed to help individuals estimate their income tax liabilities based on their annual income. It provides a simple command-line interface for now, with plans to develop a more user-friendly front end.

Note: This project is currently incomplete. The main tasks remaining are writing the front end and adding the ability to include taxable benefits and pension contributions.

Features

    Calculate income tax based on annual income and country of residence.

Usage

     Implement a user-friendly frontend.
     Add support for including taxable benefits.
     Add support for including pension contributions.
