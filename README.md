# UK Income Tax Calculator
 
This work in progress project is a UK income tax calculator designed to help individuals estimate their income tax liabilities based on their annual income. It provides a simple command-line interface for now, with plans to develop a more user-friendly front end.

Note: This project is currently in progress. The main tasks remaining are writing the front end and adding the ability to include taxable benefits and pension contributions.

Features

    Calculate income tax based on annual income and country of residence.

Usage

At current this project is working on the backend and only supports financial years (beginning) 2021-2023, as such it is a command line only project. In future this will be updated to include a user interface.

Roadmap

Here are the planned updates for this project:

     Implement a user-friendly frontend.
     Add support for including taxable benefits.
     Add support for including pension contributions.
     Add support for calculating net take home pay.
     Update tax bands and rates for additional tax years.
